## General Description:

**KaFooT** is a educational game website that derives its inspiration from Kahoot. The user can select the trivia genre from a list of categories that are pre-defined or user-defined. The user gains points based on whether or not the correct answer is selected within a set time period; there is no penalty for answering wrong. The user has the option of reading more about the current question after the answer has been selected if desired.
